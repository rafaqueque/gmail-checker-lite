# Gmail Checker Lite
This is my first Chrome extension and I started with something very simple, but useful. This does what it says and only that, without fancy features and options everywhere. It checks automcatically your Gmail inbox every minute and you're done.

## Install
To install this extension, you need to go to Chrome Webstore and search for 'gmail checker lite'.

## How to contribute
Install this manually, using the "Load unpacked extension" option and contribute to the development of this extension, if you want. Fork it, improve it and send pull requests. I'll gladly merge them!
